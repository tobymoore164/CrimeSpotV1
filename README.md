WELCOME TO CRIMESPOT!

A simple crime statistics app, used to get UK crime data based on location, crime categories and dates.

This project is a working process for a University assignment. The aim of the assignment is to effectively make use of external APIs and parsing multi length JSON strings.

My code implementation makes use of the MVC design pattern, Response Listeners for Volley Requests and good design practice throughout. I aim to make my code as maintainable and dynamic as possible.
